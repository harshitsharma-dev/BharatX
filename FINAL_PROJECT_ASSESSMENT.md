## ❌ WHAT'S NOT WORKING (FUTURE FIXES)

### ❌ Non-Working Scrapers (3/6)

1. **eBay.in/eBay.com**
   - **Issue**: Extracting "Shop on eBay" instead of product names
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect CSS selectors for product containers
   - **Status**: 62 containers found, 0 products extracted
   - **Fix Needed**: Update product title selectors

2. **Snapdeal**  
   - **Issue**: Product containers detected but no valid products
   - **Root Cause**: Title and price selectors don't match HTML structure
   - **Status**: 78 containers found, 0 products extracted
   - **Fix Needed**: Update extraction selectors for new page structure

3. **Shopsy**
   - **Issue**: Complete extraction failure
   - **Root Cause**: May need JSON API approach instead of HTML scraping
   - **Status**: 0 products extracted
   - **Fix Needed**: Research API endpoints or updated scraping approach
